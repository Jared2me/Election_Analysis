## Election-Audit Summary:
### This was a good framework for an election audit / data analysis. This script could be modified for National Elections by breaking down by State before further breaking down by County. It could also have a registered voters variable that would be checked against the National, State, and County total votes to ensure there wasn't more votes than registered voters to detect fraud.
